        <div class="sub-title">About</div>
        <div>
            <p>
                From 2014, over 4 years, the NSW government is providing funding for researchers to undertake
                whole-genome
                sequencing to improve understanding of the genetic causes for disease. The grants enable NSW researchers
                to
                access the whole genome sequencing technology at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research and to engage
                bioinformatics services.
            </p>
            <p>
                The grants will help to establish NSW as a leader in genomics and generate significant benefits for the
                NSW
                health system and community. With rapid advances in genomics over recent years, it is expected that
                these
                advances will, over time, fundamentally transform health care, with a new focus on proactive prevention
                and
                provision of tailored therapies.
            </p>
